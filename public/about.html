      <h1>About Receiptify</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Inspired by
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/albumreceipts/">@albumreceipts</a>,
        Receiptify is a tool that displays a user's 10 most-played tracks from
        the last month, last 6 months, and all time in a Receipt-like format.

      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>Why isn't Apple Music Receiptify working?</h2>
      <p>
        If nothing is happening when you try to log in with Apple Music, it may
        be because pop-ups are blocked on your browser or device. Enable them
        and try again!<br />

      <h2>What does the amount mean in top artists and genres?</h2>
      <p>
        In top artists, the amount is the popularity of the artistâ€” 1 is the
        least popular and 10 is most. In top genres, the amount is the number of
        times a genre appears in your top 50 artists.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Why doesn't my Apple Music Receiptify display top tracks by time period?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Currently, the Apple Music API only supports "Heavy Rotation," which
        returns data about your most played tracks, albums, playlists, etc. from
        an undefined time period. While I would really love to be able to break
        down this information by time period, there is unfortunately currently
        no way of getting this data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        My Spotify most-played doesn't look right! How are these stats
        determined??
      </h2>
      <p>
        The short answer is, I don't know! Receiptify uses data directly
        collected by Spotify top artists in the past month, past 6 months, and
        all time. Since this data is updated by Spotify, I'm not sure how these
        stats are calculated. If something looks off in your recently-played
        data for the month, it may be because there's a slight offset in when
        the "past month" top track calculations are made. Otherwise, you may
        just be playing some tracks more than you thought!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Can you show the number of times a track is played in Spotify
        Receiptify?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the Spotify API does not provide this information.
        However, if you have last.fm, you can see this information in the
        last.fm version of Receiptify.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>My Receiptify isn't working!</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes, Receiptify might run into errors when there is increased
        traffic. If you've already logged in, try to keep refreshing the site
        until your receipt shows up. If that doesn't work, try clearing your
        cookies and site data or try a different device.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Can you make Receiptify for [music streaming service]?</h2>
      <p>
        Some music streaming services don't have accessible API's to retrieve
        your listening data. While I would love to support as many services as
        possible, I'm a full-time student, so I'm not always able to get to
        these requests, especially in busy times.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>How did you make Receiptify???</h2>
      <p>
        Receiptify is an open-source tool! You can view the code
        <a href="https://github.com/michellexliu/receiptify">here</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Will Receiptify steal my data?</h2>
      <p>
        In short: NO! For more information, view Receiptify's
